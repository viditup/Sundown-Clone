## Project Overview

This project replicates the **Sundown Studio** website design, offering dynamic visual elements and smooth scrolling effects to simulate the feel of an actual design studio's portfolio website. The website includes several pages with different layouts, including a landing page, a portfolio gallery, and an interactive footer.

## Features
- **Dynamic Scrolling:** Utilizes [Locomotive Scroll](https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/) for smooth scrolling effects.
- **Image Hover Effects:** Interactive hover animations on images and text.
- **Video Background:** Video autoplaying in the background of the first section to give a modern look.
- **Swiper Gallery:** Interactive gallery that showcases a list of projects in a carousel.
- **Custom Fonts and Styling:** Utilizes custom typography to match the Sundown Studio aesthetic.
